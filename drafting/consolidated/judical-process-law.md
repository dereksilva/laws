##### Section 2: Protection of a weaker party  
When the protection of a weaker party, such as a party with a sensory impairment, requires interpretation or transcription to make the process understandable for that party, and the use of legal counsel is insufficient, or the party can prove that they have insufficient means to obtain such legal counsel, the Judge shall waive the requirement for the party to cover the expenses for translation or interpretation services. Additionally, the Judge shall make any necessary accommodations to allow the party to present their case reasonably.

## Chapter 2: Core Concepts  

#### Article 14: Role of the Judge
1. The Judge is the official through which a court acts in matters of the judicial process.
2. A Judge or Judges preside over any judicial process and make the final decision resolving any dispute, question, or other matter presented before the court.
The Judge shall also be the final arbiter deciding on the correct procedure in every situation before the court.

#### Article 15: Composition of Judicial Panels
1. Where multiple Judges are presiding over a process, they shall decide the case together and always be of an even number.
2. No Judge shall have higher deciding power than any other Judge.

#### Article 16: Assigning Judges

2. No party shall be deprived of a Judge assigned to them, except where the party gives their express permission.

#### Article 17: Judicial conduct

##### Section 1: Impartiality  
1. The Judge shall act impartially and in the interest of justice, upholding legitimately obtained private property and being mindful of the personal situations of the parties and their power differences.
2. The Judge shall base each statement in any verdict on evidence and well-reasoned logic only, and according to law and principles of justice.
After a case has commenced, there shall be no ex parte communication between the Judge and the parties, or between the court and other persons relevant to the case, such as witnesses, unless explicitly permitted by consent of all parties.

##### Section 2: Partial Judges  
1. A Judge who has a personal connection to one or more of the parties or the object of the case shall be deemed partial where that connection is Judged sufficient to influence their decision-making.
2. If a party suspects partiality, they may appeal to the court, which shall appoint three Judges to decide on the impartiality of the fellow Judge. A Judge in doubt of being partial may also initiate this process themselves.
3. A partial Judge shall be replaced according to the rules of the court. Partiality in itself shall not be counted against the Judge without it having led to unjust decisions or breaches of due process, or without it having been found in extenuating circumstances (i.e., the Judge must have known that they were partial and not reported it).
4. A court or higher court, where applicable, shall re-examine a judicial decision made and a judicial process presided by a partial Judge, regardless of the procedural stage at which impartiality has been established.

#### Article 18 Judicial Orders
1. A Judge may issue various interim pre-trial orders or measures to ensure that the circumstances of the case remain sufficiently stable for adjudication. Parties shall comply with these orders, or the Judge may impose penalties up to the case's value, with the maximum penalty being the total forfeiture of all points on the case for the non-compliant party.
2. A Judge may use the following order:

   a) **Restraining/Compelling Order**: Short-term orders issued to prevent a party from engaging in certain actions that could harm the other party or the case itself.

   c) **Discovery Orders**: Orders compelling parties to produce evidence relevant to the case, such as documents, records, or depositions.

   d) **Protective Orders**: Orders issued to safeguard sensitive information from public disclosure or to prevent harassment of witnesses.

   e) **Scheduling Orders**: Orders establishing deadlines for various stages of the litigation process, including discovery, motions, and trial.

   f) **Asset Freezes**: Orders, where appropriate, directing that a party's assets be frozen to prevent their sale or transfer pending resolution of the case.

   g) **Custody or Visitation Orders**: In family law cases, temporary orders may be issued regarding child custody or visitation to ensure stability for the children involved.

   h) **Bail or Bond Orders**: In criminal cases, orders may be issued setting bail or bond conditions to ensure the defendant's appearance at trial.

   j) **Sequestration of Witnesses**: Orders, where appropriate, directing that witnesses be kept separate from each other to prevent them from influencing each other's testimony.

Certainly! Here's a draft of a law regarding the issuance and execution of warrants:

2. Law Enforcement Officers executing a warrant shall identify themselves, present the warrant to the person subject to the warrant or the occupant of the place to be searched, and provide a receipt for any property seized.
3. In exigent circumstances, where there is a risk of imminent harm to persons, destruction of evidence, or flight of a suspect, Law Enforcement Officers may take necessary actions without a warrant, provided that they subsequently obtain a warrant or present the circumstances to a Judge for review.

1. Agencies charged with police duties shall maintain records of all warrants issued and executed relevant to their activities, including the basis for the warrant, the items seized, and the outcome of any related proceedings.

3. A delivery is considered finalized upon the verified transmission of the electronic communication or upon consigning the package to a suitable delivery institution and securing a receipt of registration. This presumption can be challenged by showcasing evidence that the actual delivery encountered delays due to unforeseen circumstances beyond the recipient's purview, which they couldn't avert despite exercising due diligence.

Deliveries intended for foreign individuals or entities shall be facilitated through postal services or comparable mechanisms. Alternatively, when practical, the collaboration of foreign administrative agencies can be sought.

3. The court shall ensure that the special rules for non-controversial cases are accessible and comprehensible to all parties, including self-represented litigants, to facilitate their effective participation in the judicial process.

##### Section 2: Reclasification of non-controversial cases to controversial cases
