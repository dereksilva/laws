#### Section 2: No-knock Entry

Where the entry is declared illegal, those damaged by it may seek recourse by the Court against Liberland.

### Article 22: Weapon Use

b) Self-protection with respect to the Agent's life and health;

c) Suppressing resistance against the execution of their official duty within limits judged reasonably necessary where significant damage or loss of life or health are at stake; and

d) Apprehending a dangerous or violent criminal or preventing their escape when the use of force is deemed necessary to accomplish this.

When using a lethal weapon, the Agent shall aim to injure rather than kill the targeted person whenever possible without clearly compromising the purpose of the weapon use.
