### Article 22: Submission of a Reasoned Objection
1) In general, if the addressed party accepts the On-Site Payment Order, they shall be deemed to have waived their right to lodge objections. However, if the party can demonstrate that they were uninformed, incapable of providing informed consent, or subject to other extenuating circumstances, they may submit a Reasoned Objection within one month of their acceptance.
2) Unlike a standard Objection, a Reasoned Objection shall incorporate the reasons elucidating the circumstances and providing evidence in support of their assertions.
3) The Administrative Organ shall review the Reasoned Objection and, if it determines that the arguments possess merit, shall rescind the Payment Order, and it will be as if an Objection was lodged within the prescribed timeframe.
