The Administrative Body shall review the Reasoned Objection and, if it determines that the arguments possess merit, shall rescind the Payment Order, and it will be as if an Objection was lodged within the prescribed timeframe. When there is doubt, the Administrative Body shall accept the Reasoned Objection.
