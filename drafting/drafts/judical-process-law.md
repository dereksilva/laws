## Chapter 2: Core Concepts  

### Article 14: Role of the judge
1. The judge is the official through which a court acts in matters of the judicial process.
2. A judge or judges preside over any judicial process and make the final decision resolving any dispute, question, or other matter presented before the court.
The judge shall also be the final arbiter deciding on the correct procedure in every situation before the court.

### Article 15: Composition of judicial panels
1. Where multiple judges are presiding over a process, they shall decide the case together and always be of an even number.
2. No judge shall have higher deciding power than any other judge.

After a case has commenced, there shall be no ex parte communication between the judge and the parties, or between the court and other persons relevant to the case, such as witnesses, unless explicitly permitted by consent of all parties.

#### Section 2: Partial judges  
1. A judge who has a personal connection to one or more of the parties or the object of the case shall be deemed partial where that connection is judged sufficient to influence their decision-making.
2. If a party suspects partiality, they may appeal to the court, which shall appoint three judges to decide on the impartiality of the fellow judge. A judge in doubt of being partial may also initiate this process themselves.
3. A partial judge shall be replaced according to the rules of the court. Partiality in itself shall not be counted against the judge without it having led to unjust decisions or breaches of due process, or without it having been found in extenuating circumstances (i.e., the judge must have known that they were partial and not reported it).
4. A court or higher court, where applicable, shall re-examine a judicial decision made and a judicial process presided by a partial judge, regardless of the procedural stage at which impartiality has been established.

### Article 18: Judicial Decisions

However, the judge shall be required to articulate the rationale for their decisions.

#### Section 2: Form and availability of judicial decisions
1. A judicial decision may be delivered orally or in writing. Regardless of the form of delivery, a written copy of the decision, signed and certified by the judge, shall be made available at the judge's discretion or upon request by a party. In case of a difference between the oral and written version the written version shall take precedence.
2. In cases where translation services are utilized, written translations into other languages shall be provided concurrently. The decision becomes binding upon the court once it is signed by the judge.

#### Section 1: Simplified rules for non-controversial cases 
1. Non-controversial cases shall be subject to a simplified and expedited judicial process, designed to resolve matters efficiently and without undue delay.

3. The court shall ensure that the special rules for non-controversial cases are accessible and comprehensible to all parties, including self-represented litigants, to facilitate their effective participation in the judicial process.

#### Section 2: Reclasification of non-controversial cases to controversial cases
