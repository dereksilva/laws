# Referendum Law

## Preamble

WHEREAS, the Referendum of all Citizens is the primary instrument of Legislative Power in Liberland, reflecting the principle that citizens themselves wield the legislative power directly, with elements of representative democracy and corporate governance;

WHEREAS, the citizens shall vote using voting instruments, the Liberland Merits (LLM), and the referendum shall be generally organized using means of electronic communication, namely blockchain, to ensure transparency, speed, and security;

WHEREAS, in order to satisfy the requirements of Art. 25 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights of 1955, which calls for genuine periodic elections by universal and equal suffrage, held by secret ballot, guaranteeing the free expression of the will of the electors, a referendum where each citizen holds one vote shall also be held;

WHEREAS, this referendum will be used to remove unwanted laws and regulations and dismiss officials, ensuring that all laws and regulations are democratically legitimate at all times and preventing government overreach;

WHEREAS, legislative initiative shall be in the hands of the representative organ (Congress) but also in the hand of each and every citizen;

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ENACTED by the Parliament of Liberland as follows:

## Recitals

1. This law sets up the rules for the Referendum of all Citizens, which is the primary instrument of Legislative Power in Liberland.

2. In Liberland, the citizens themselves wield the legislative power directly, with elements of representative democracy and corporate governance.

3. The citizens shall vote using voting instruments, the Liberland Merits (LLM), and the referendum shall be generally organized using means of electronic communication, namely blockchain, to ensure transparency, speed, and security.

4. If needed, a paper referendum is also possible.

5. In order to satisfy the requirements of Art. 25 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights of 1955, a referendum where each citizen holds one vote shall also be held.

6. This referendum will be used to remove unwanted laws and regulations and dismiss officials, ensuring that all laws and regulations are democratically legitimate at all times and preventing government overreach.

7. Legislative initiative shall be in the hands of the representative organ (Congress) but also in the hand of each and every citizen.

8. In order to ensure stability and prevent populism and "surprising" adoption of laws by referenda with low turnover, an anti-populist measure is enacted, whereby the lower the turnout, the higher the voting requirement; e.g., people-originated referenda would require 50 percent plus one voting instrument cast for to be accepted only at 100 percent turnout.
   
## Section 1: Referendum

#### Art. 1: Primary Instrument of Democracy

§ 1

The Referendum, as the primary instrument of democracy in Liberland, shall enable Citizens to make collective decisions and to create Regulations. The Referendum shall allow all citizens to participate.

§ 2

1. The Referendum shall be the most important decision-making process within Liberland and in the Administration, and no other decision-making process shall be able to overturn a Referendum decision.
2. As the Executive Power is responsible for the Legislative Power, the Referendum may, in turn, overturn and replace any other decision-making process within the Legislative or Executive power of the Administration.
3. Conversely, the Referendum can't directly overturn a judicial decision, but it can organize matters in the Judiciary by making Laws. The Referendum shall only influence the Guardians of the Republic through Constitutional Amendments and to the degree Dismissal as prescribed by the Constitution allows it.&#x20;

#### Art. 2: Blockchain System

§ 1

1. The Referendum shall be realized by means of electronic communications using a public blockchain system capable of hosting governance.&#x20;
2. The system shall be sufficiently decentralized and secure to minimize risks of unauthorized tampering of all kinds, as well as user-friendly so that the vast majority of Citizens have no problem operating it.

§ 2

The Administration shall ensure such a system capable of fulfilling the requirements of this Law is built or adopted and that it is regularly maintained.

#### Art. 3: Voting Tokens

§ 1

1. The voting in the Referendum shall generally take place using Liberland Merits (LLM) as voting tokens, which Citizens shall be able to purchase on the open market.&#x20;
2. The Public Veto, a special form of the Referendum as prescribed by the Constitution, shall also be organized for matters required therein. The Public Veto shall include the options of voting on Dismissal of Judges, the President and the Vice-Presidents.

§ 2

The only form of LLM allowed for use in Referenda shall be politically pooled LLM. Political pooling entails limiting the liquidity of LLM, so that they can't be sent to a different wallet for the duration of the political pooling.&#x20;

#### Art. 4: Referendum Period

The Referendum Period shall be 14 days. At the end of the Referendum period in which a Proposal has been converted into a Referendum, the Proposal is either Approved or Rejected.

#### Art. 5: Cancelling

1. In each Referendum stage before the end of the Referendum Period in which the Proposal has been converted into a Referendum, the Congress cancellation as prescribed by the Constitution may occur.&#x20;
2. In the Enactment Period following the Approval of a Referendum, no Congress-originated Cancellation may take place, but the Senate may still Cancel the Proposal. In that case, Congress shall cancel the Proposal for the Senate, even at this stage.

## Section 2: Proposals

#### Art. 6: Making Proposals

§ 1

In order to start a Referendum, a proposal must be submitted using the Blockchain system as prescribed by this Law.&#x20;

§ 2

Any Citizen can submit a Proposal in the system, in which case the origin of the Proposal shall be registered as "Citizen".

§ 3

The Congress can collectively submit a Proposal in the system, which the system will give the origin of "Congress". There are two forms of a Congress Origin Proposal:

a) where the entire Congress makes an unanimous decision to make this Proposal, registered as Unanimous Proposal; or

b) where a simple majority in the Congress makes the Proposal.

#### Art. 7: Endorsement

1. Any Citizen can support any Proposal by pledging their LLM into it. Pledged LLM shall be locked and the Citizen shall be barred from using them elsewhere in politics. Endorsement increases the change of the Proposal being converted into a Referendum.
2. The LLM shall be freed up upon the Proposal being converted into a Referendum. If that doesn't occur within the span of ten Referendum Periods following the period in which the Endorsement took place, the Citizen shall have the option of cancelling the Endorsement and unlocking the LLM.

#### Art. 8: View of Proposals

The system shall entail a view in which all active Proposals are listed. This view shall include the following data

a) Name of the Proposal;

b) the Origin of the Proposal;

c) the link to the personal page of the Citizen or Congress Member who made the Proposal;

d) the rate of Endorsement;

e) the proposed Enactment Period;  and

f) the date on which the Proposal was made.

#### Art. 9: Converting Proposals into Referenda

1. The system shall include an algorithm that selects a Proposal at the beginning of each Referendum Period to be converted into a Referendum.&#x20;
2. The algorithm will cycle between the Citizen and Congress Origin, beginning with the Congress Origin, so that in odd Periods, a Proposal is selected from the Citizen Origin and in even Periods, a Proposal is selected from the Congress Origin.
3. The algorithm shall always select the most endorsed Proposal per given Origin for conversion.

## Section 3: Voting on Referenda

#### Art. 10: Voting

All Citizens shall have the right to vote using their LLM. Citizens can repeatedly vote for the same Referendum. If so, the newest voting replaces the previous voting.

#### Art. 11: Deciding Referenda

1. The system shall decide the Referendum based on the votes count at the moment the Referendum Period ends, comparing the result with the Tally required for approval based on the given origin.&#x20;
2. When the Tally is reached, the Referendum ends with the Approval of the Proposal, and the Enactment Period starts.&#x20;
3. Otherwise, the Referendum ends with the Rejection of the Proposal, which is discarded.

#### Art. 12: Tally

The following shall be Referendum tallies for the general Referendum required for the Referendum to Adopt the Proposal:

a) For the origin Citizen, the Tally shall be counted as the number of votes against divided by the square root of the turnout must be smaller than the number of votes approve divided by the square root of the electorate; henceforth, "Super-Majority Approve";

b) For the origin Congress, the Tally shall be counted as the simple majority of the votes cast, henceforth "Simple Majority".

c) For the origin Congress Unanimous, the Tally shall be counted as the number of votes against divided by the square root of the electorate must be smaller than the number of votes approved divided by the square root of the turnout, henceforth "Super-Majority Against".

#### Art. 13: View of Voting

The system shall entail a view in which all active Referenda are listed. This view shall include the following data

a) Name of the Referendum;

b) the Origin of the Referendum;

c) the link to the personal page of the Citizen or Congress Member who had made the original Proposal;

d) the Tally required for the Adoption of a Proposal;

e) the current Votes;  and

e) the relevant Referendum Period.

#### Art. 14: Enactment Period

The Proposal shall gain legal force after its Enactment Period has run its course. The Proposal can be vetoed during that time by the Senate using Cancellation or by Citizens using Public Veto.

## Section 4: Public Veto

#### Art. 15: Proposing a Public Veto

1. A Public Veto can be proposed by a Citizen by bonding 1000 LLM into the Proposal. The Proposal shall be admissible on a:

a) Regulation or an Adopted Referendum in the Enactment Period phase; or

c) Judge, Vice-President or the President.

1. Upon submitting the Proposal, it becomes a Referendum at the beginning of the next Referendum Period.

#### Art. 16: Voting on a Public Veto

The Voting on a Public Veto is conducted in the same manner as voting on a general Referendum, but each Citizen can only use one LLM for each Public Veto. The Constitution prescribes the Tallies.

## Section 5: Final Provision

#### Art. 17: Legal Force

This Law takes legal force at the end of a standard Enactment Period following its adoption in the Referendum.
