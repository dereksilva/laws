# Referendum Law

## Preamble

WHEREAS, the Referendum of all Citizens is the primary instrument of Legislative Power in Liberland, reflecting the principle that citizens themselves wield the legislative power directly, with elements of representative democracy and corporate governance;

WHEREAS, the citizens shall vote using voting instruments, the Liberland Merits (LLM), and the referendum shall be generally organized using means of electronic communication, namely blockchain, to ensure transparency, speed, and security;

WHEREAS, in order to satisfy the requirements of Article 25 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights of 1955, which calls for genuine periodic elections by universal and equal suffrage, held by secret ballot, guaranteeing the free expression of the will of the electors, a referendum where each citizen holds one vote shall also be held;

WHEREAS, this referendum will be used to remove unwanted laws and regulations and dismiss officials, ensuring that all laws and regulations are democratically legitimate at all times and preventing government overreach;

WHEREAS, legislative initiative shall be in the hands of the representative organ (Congress) but also in the hand of each and every citizen;

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ENACTED by the Parliament of Liberland as follows:

## Recitals

1. This law sets up the rules for the Referendum of all Citizens, which is the primary instrument of Legislative Power in Liberland.

2. In Liberland, the citizens themselves wield the legislative power directly, with elements of representative democracy and corporate governance.

3. The citizens shall vote using voting instruments, the Liberland Merits (LLM), and the referendum shall be generally organized using means of electronic communication, namely blockchain, to ensure transparency, speed, and security.

4. If needed, a paper referendum is also possible.

5. In order to satisfy the requirements of Article 25 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights of 1955, a referendum where each citizen holds one vote shall also be held.

6. This referendum will be used to remove unwanted laws and regulations and dismiss officials, ensuring that all laws and regulations are democratically legitimate at all times and preventing government overreach.

7. Legislative initiative shall be in the hands of the representative organ (Congress) but also in the hand of each and every citizen.

8. In order to ensure stability and prevent populism and "surprising" adoption of laws by referenda with low turnover, an anti-populist measure is enacted, whereby the lower the turnout, the higher the voting requirement; e.g., people-originated referenda would require 50 percent plus one voting instrument cast for to be accepted only at 100 percent turnout.
   
## Chapter 1: Referendum

### Article 1: Primary Instrument of Democracy
#### Section 1: Purpose of the Referendum
The Referendum, as the primary instrument of democracy in Liberland, shall empower Citizens to make collective decisions and to enact Laws and other types of Regulations. The Referendum shall be open to participation by all citizens.

#### Section 2: Supremacy of the Referendum
1. The Referendum shall be the paramount decision-making process within Liberland and the Government, and no other decision-making process shall have the authority to overturn a Referendum decision.
2. As the Executive Power is accountable to the Legislative Power, the Referendum may supersede and replace any other decision-making process within the Legislative or Executive branches of the Government.
3. However, the Referendum shall not directly overturn a judicial decision. Instead, it may shape matters within the Judiciary by enacting Laws. The Referendum shall only influence the Guardians of the Republic through Constitutional Amendments and to the extent that Dismissal, as prescribed by the Constitution, permits.

### Article 2: Blockchain System
#### Section 1: Implementation of the Referendum
1. The Referendum shall be conducted through electronic communications using a public blockchain system capable of hosting governance.
2. The system shall be sufficiently decentralized and secure to minimize risks of unauthorized tampering of all kinds, and user-friendly enough to ensure that the vast majority of Citizens can operate it with ease.

#### Section 2: Government Responsibility
The Government shall ensure the establishment or adoption of a system capable of meeting the requirements of this Law and shall provide for its regular maintenance.

### Article 3: Voting Instruments
#### Section 1: Voting Mechanism
1. Voting in the Referendum shall generally be conducted using Liberland Merits (LLM) as voting instruments, which Citizens shall be able to purchase on the open market.
2. The Public Veto, a special form of the Referendum as prescribed by the Constitution, shall also be organized for matters required therein. The Public Veto shall include the options of voting on Dismissal of Judges, the President, and the Vice-Presidents.

#### Section 2: Politically Pooled LLM
The only form of LLM permitted for use in Referenda shall be politically pooled LLM. Political pooling involves restricting the liquidity of LLM, such that they cannot be transferred to a different wallet for the duration of the political pooling.

### Article 4: Referendum Period
The Referendum Period shall be 14 days. At the end of the Referendum period in which a Proposal has been converted into a Referendum, the Proposal is either Approved or Rejected.

### Article 5: Cancellation
#### Section 1: Cancellation During Referendum Period
In each Referendum stage before the end of the Referendum Period in which the Proposal has been converted into a Referendum, Congress cancellation as prescribed by the Constitution may occur.

#### Section 2: Cancellation During Enactment Period
In the Enactment Period following the Approval of a Referendum, no Congress-originated Cancellation may take place, but the Senate may still Cancel the Proposal. In such cases, Congress shall cancel the Proposal for the Senate, even at this stage.

## Chapter 2: Proposals

### Article 6: Making Proposals

#### Section 1: Submission of Proposals

To initiate a Referendum, a proposal must be submitted using the Blockchain system as prescribed by this Law.

#### Section 2: Citizen Proposals

Any Citizen may submit a Proposal in the system, in which case the origin of the Proposal shall be registered as "Citizen."

#### Section 3: Congress Proposals

The Congress may collectively submit a Proposal in the system, which will be designated with the origin of "Congress." There are two forms of a Congress Origin Proposal:

   a) Unanimous Proposal: Where the entire Congress makes a unanimous decision to make this Proposal.
   b) Majority Proposal: Where a simple majority in Congress makes the Proposal.

### Article 7: Endorsement

#### Section 1: Supporting Proposals

Any Citizen may support any Proposal by pledging their LLM into it. Pledged LLM shall be locked, and the Citizen shall be barred from using them elsewhere in politics. Endorsement increases the chance of the Proposal being converted into a Referendum.

#### Section 2: Release of Pledged LLM

The LLM shall be freed up upon the Proposal being converted into a Referendum. If that does not occur within the span of ten Referendum Periods following the period in which the Endorsement took place, the Citizen shall have the option of canceling the Endorsement and unlocking the LLM.

### Article 8: View of Proposals

The system shall provide a view in which all active Proposals are listed. This view shall include the following data:

   a) Name of the Proposal;
   b) Origin of the Proposal;
   c) Link to the personal page of the Citizen or Congress Member who made the Proposal;
   d) Rate of Endorsement;
   e) Proposed Enactment Period; and
   f) Date on which the Proposal was made.

### Article 9: Converting Proposals into Referenda

#### Section 1: Selection Algorithm

The system shall incorporate an algorithm that selects a Proposal at the beginning of each Referendum Period to be converted into a Referendum.

#### Section 2: Cycling Between Origins

The algorithm will alternate between the Citizen and Congress Origins, starting with the Congress Origin, so that in odd Periods, a Proposal is selected from the Citizen Origin and in even Periods, a Proposal is selected from the Congress Origin.

#### Section 3: Selection Criteria

The algorithm shall always select the most endorsed Proposal per given Origin for conversion.

## Chapter 3: Voting on Referenda

### Article 10: Voting

1. All Citizens shall have the right to vote using their LLM. Citizens may vote multiple times for the same Referendum, with each subsequent vote replacing the previous one.

### Article 11: Deciding Referenda

1. The system shall determine the outcome of the Referendum based on the vote count at the moment the Referendum Period ends, comparing the result with the Tally required for approval based on the given origin.
2. If the Tally is reached, the Referendum concludes with the Approval of the Proposal, and the Enactment Period begins.
3. If the Tally is not reached, the Referendum concludes with the Rejection of the Proposal, which is then discarded.

### Article 12: Tally

1. The following shall be the Referendum tallies for the general Referendum required for the Referendum to Adopt the Proposal:

   a) For the origin Citizen, the Tally shall be calculated as the number of votes against divided by the square root of the turnout must be smaller than the number of votes approve divided by the square root of the electorate, henceforth referred to as "Super-Majority Approve".
   b) For the origin Congress, the Tally shall be calculated as the simple majority of the votes cast, henceforth referred to as "Simple Majority".
   c) For the origin Congress Unanimous, the Tally shall be calculated as the number of votes against divided by the square root of the electorate must be smaller than the number of votes approved divided by the square root of the turnout, henceforth referred to as "Super-Majority Against".

### Article 13: View of Voting

1. The system shall provide a view in which all active Referenda are listed. This view shall include the following data:

   a) Name of the Referendum;
   b) Origin of the Referendum;
   c) Link to the personal page of the Citizen or Congress Member who made the original Proposal;
   d) Tally required for the Adoption of a Proposal;
   e) Current Votes; and
   f) Relevant Referendum Period.

### Article 14: Enactment Period

1. The Proposal shall gain legal force after its Enactment Period has run its course. The Proposal may be vetoed during that time by the Senate using Cancellation or by Citizens using Public Veto.

## Chapter 4: Public Veto

### Article 15: Proposing a Public Veto

1. A Public Veto may be proposed by a Citizen by bonding 1000 LLM into the Proposal. The Proposal shall be admissible on a:

   a) Regulation or an Adopted Referendum in the Enactment Period phase; or
   b) Judge, Vice-President, or the President.

2. Upon submitting the Proposal, it becomes a Referendum at the beginning of the next Referendum Period.

### Article 16: Voting on a Public Veto

1. Voting on a Public Veto is conducted in the same manner as voting on a general Referendum, but each Citizen may only use one LLM for each Public Veto. The Constitution prescribes the Tallies.

## Chapter 5: Final Provision

### Article 17: Legal Force

1. This Law takes legal force at the end of a standard Enactment Period following its adoption in the Referendum.
