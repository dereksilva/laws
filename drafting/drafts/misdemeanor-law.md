# Delict Law

## Chapter 1: General provisions

### Title 1: Delicts

#### Article 1: Definition of Delict

A delict is defined as either:

a) An action that breaches the Non-Aggression Principle, leading to identifiable harm to another person, or, in exceptional cases,

b) An action that significantly violates established laws, irrespective of whether the victim is easily identifiable.

2. Any individual, whether they are permanently or temporarily under the jurisdiction of Liberland, is responsible for the delicts they commit. If found guilty, they are obligated to make restitution to the victims and will be subject to penalties as outlined in this law to deter future delictual behavior.

#### Article 2: Definition and Scope of Misdemeanor
A Misdemeanor is any Delict defined as such in this Law.

#### Article 3: Definition and Scope of Disciplinary Offense
1. Liberland shall exercise disciplinary jurisdiction over all government agents or volunteers participating in public projects who are physically present within its territory or are engaged in tasks that are vital to the settlement and directly related to it. Such individuals are henceforth referred to as persons "on active duty."
2. A Disciplinary Offense is a Delict committed by a person on active duty, as defined in this Law.

### Title 2: Principles of Liability for Delicts

#### Article 4: Concurrent commission of multiple Delicts

##### Section 1: General Principle
Where multiple delicts are committed by a single action, only the Delict punishable by the most severe penalty shall be committed.

##### Section 2: Crimes and other Delicts
1. Where an act constitutes a Crime and also another Delict, in general, only the Crime shall be prosecuted according to the Criminal Law. 
2. In certain specific cases where this Law stipulates otherwise, committing crimes also results in the responsibility for other types of Delict.

#### Article 5: Attempted Delict
An attempted Delict shall be punishable in the same manner as a finished Delict, though the punishment might be less severe based on the circumstance.

#### Article 6: Continued Delict
A continuing Delict is understood to mean such conduct wherein individual constituent acts, guided by a unified intent, fulfil the elements of the same offence and are connected by the same or similar means of execution, close temporal proximity, and subject matter relatedness.

#### Article 7: Mass Offense
A mass offence is an offence for which the law requires multiple acts connected by a common intent for liability to arise for the offence.

#### Article 8: Omission
For the purposes of this law, "conduct" also includes the omission of such action to which the actor was obligated pursuant to another legal regulation or official decision, resulting from a voluntarily assumed duty to law or if his special obligation arose from his previous endangering conduct, or for which he was obligated for another reason based on the circumstances and his conditions.

#### Article 9: Co-offender
1. If a Delict or its attempt was committed by the intentional joint conduct of two or more individuals, each is liable as if they had committed the Delict alone.

2. If the Delict was committed by joint conduct of two or more entities, of which at least one is a legal person or a self-employed individual, each is liable as if they had committed the Delict alone.

#### Article 10: Special subject of a Delict
If the law requires a special characteristic, qualification, or status of the perpetrator for the commission of a Delict, the following may apply:

  a) The perpetrator can only be one who possesses the required characteristic, qualification, or status.

  b) A co-perpetrator can be one who possesses the required characteristic, qualification, or status, and also one who does not possess the required characteristic, qualification, or status, provided that at least one of the co-perpetrators possesses the required characteristic, qualification, or status.
